<h1><strong>LEATHER & RUBBER</strong></h1>
<p>
	<h3>LEATHER</h3>
	<p>Most recycled leather is a composite of shredded leather scraps and residues collected from tanneries and other leather product manufacturers. ... The finished recycled leather product will have the look and feel of new, non-recycled leather. In general, recycled leather is less expensive than its traditional counterpart.
    </p>
    <h3>RUBBER</h3>
    <p>Tire recycling, or rubber recycling, is the process of recycling waste tires that are no longer suitable for use on vehicles due to wear or irreparable damage. ... Because tires are highly durable and non-biodegradable, they can consume valued space in landfills.
