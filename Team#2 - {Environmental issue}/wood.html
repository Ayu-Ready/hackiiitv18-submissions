<h1><strong>WOOD</strong></h1>
<p>
	Timber <strong>recycling</strong> or <strong>wood recycling</strong> is the process of turning waste timber into usable products. Recycling timber is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change prompted both timber suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable timber source.
